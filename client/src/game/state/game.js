/**
 * @class GameState
 * 
 * @description 
 * This class serves as an "archetype entity container" and global state 
 * manager. 
 * It organizes entities into specialized containers based on fixed 
 * compositions, allowing various systems to access data directly without
 * performing runtime entity-type checks.
 *
 * This specialized implementation intentionally forgoes the full flexibility of 
 * a generic ECS entity-component system, which means that while it is more 
 * performant and simpler to work with for our use-case, it may not support 
 * dynamic component compositions.
